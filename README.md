# Heather Drayson

Hi there 👋 I'm Heather 🙂 I recently discovered and like this approach to being an engineer: https://1x.engineer/

🔭 I’m currently working on Staff Pulse at TES - a tool to measure and improve the wellbeing of teachers, working with Javascript, Node.js, React/Redux, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Postgres, SQL, Sequelize, Docker, Git version control, Jenkins, OOP, TDD, and pair programming. I also have experience with Typescript and GraphQL 👩‍💻

🌱 I’m currently learning about gardening and the best ways to combine rewilding and food production in my garden in Bexhill-on-Sea 👩‍🌾

💬 Ask me about yoga - I completed a physiotherapy informed teacher training while furloughed in Spring 2020 🤸‍♀️

🤔 - I'm often wondering and reading about a mix of philosophy, theology and psychology, which I find endlessly fascinating subjects. This has broadened by empathy and compassion, which I hope to one day somehow help others to do 🌞

💪 A fear I'm working to overcome is sharing my knowledge, skills and passions with the world via writing ✍️

⚡ Fun fact: I once drove the ferry 'cross the Mersey when I was 16 🚢

🕵️‍♀️ In previous lives I have achieved a degree in chemistry 👩‍🔬, been a science teacher 👩‍🏫, and even a SCUBA instructor 🧜‍♀️
