I am passionate about learning, which has led me to a career as a full stack software engineer. I have 10 months experience working with Javascript, the MERN stack, microservices and AMQP at EdTech company Tes Global, helping to improve millions teachers' worklives and helping schools to recruit and train thousands of teachers all over the world. 

After graduating with a degree in Chemistry, I was awarded a scholarship from the Confucius Institute to study Basic Mandarin in China, after which I decided to pursue life as a SCUBA diving instructor in the Philippines. This led me to the decision to become a teacher and was awarded a teacher training scholarship from the Royal Society of Chemistry, but my thirst for learning was often overshadowed by the demands on time being a teacher involves. 

Makers has proven that I have the skills to work with other novice developers, learn new technologies and produce a tested product that's fun to use in just 8 days - all the while having fun and helping each other succeed. I am excited and eager to put these skills into action and start contributing to products and experiences that enrich people's day to day lives.

### <a name="skills">Skills</a>

**XP Values** - Even before I knew what "XP values" meant, I have been striving to embody them in my previous roles. 
*Communication* - As a SCUBA instructor and science teacher, communication was imperative for the progress of my students, as was taking complex abstract ideas and breaking them down into simple concrete examples. I now am champion of the study club at Tes Global, helping my colleages solve problems and gain new knowledge and skills, even those that are more experienced than I.

*Feedback* - Giving feedback in a constructive manner was essential during my time teaching (see my blog on [feedback](https://medium.com/@heatherstock/nice-next-time-now-ideas-for-effective-feedback-8d24634efd28)), as was deciphering the feedback my students were constantly displaying, such as in their approach to a challenge for example. 

*Courage* - Having courage was a huge aspect to these roles, showing up each day to help students achieve their goals and respecting them as individuals with individual challenges and learning journeys. 

**Problem Solving** - I love a good problem to solve. From thinking about the best way to present a new idea to a class of 30 teenagers as a science teacher, to in the moment decision making when a novice SCUBA diver had a problem and it was my responsibility to help. My experience beyond the tech industry allows me insights into problems that more experienced engineers listen to and act upon. 

**Time Management** - Throughout my PGCE and my time teaching I have displayed excellent time management and organisation, planning lessons, creating resources, completing dissertations, tracking progress of myself and my students, writing reports and more. Oh, and teaching of course!
